# IconEdit

## Simple icon editor for the FlipperZero

Create 10x10 images directly on the Flipper! The live preview allows you to see how your icons will look, without having to re-build your application or transfer the file after every edit.

## Features

* Pixel level editing
* Create lines, circles, and rectangles
* Open `.png` files
* Save your icons as `.png`, `.xbm`, and even in a C source file format!
  * Simpy copy the saved `.png` files from your SD card to your application's `images` folder to be included in your next build
* Real time preview of your icon in actual size

## Planned (or not) features

* Multiple frames, for icon animations
* Send to PC via USB - would directly send the .C source to your editor - no file transfer necessary!
* Support for variable sized images (not just 10x10)
* Improved UI
